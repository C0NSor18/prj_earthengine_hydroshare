# EarthEngine HydroShare
This is an ongoing work to integrate Google EarthEngine (GEE) API funtionality into HydroShare in Python 3.x language for the Utah State University CEE/PSC/WATS 5003/6003 Remote Sensing of Land Surfaces Spring class. 

### Objectives of this git repository: 

* Use HydroShare to teach remote sensing under limited local computing (tablets).

* Investigate ways to do research by combining Google EarthEngine API, Google Drive API, and HydroShare.

* Bring into Python language available online GEE JavaScript/Python examples.

### Current operational status:
This is a funtional "alpha" version of the repository (April 2019). I consider it "alpha" because it has not been tested on another HydroShare/EarthEngine account (validation needed). 

Suggestions, collaboration, and questions are more than welcome!

### HOW TO USE THIS REPOSITORY:

* Clone this repository into Hydroshare. The notebook "Git commands for HydroShare.ipynb" in this repository gives necessary information to do this.

* If not done already, register for an Google Earth Engine account (free) and follow the steps in the notebook "EE_Hydroshare_installation.ipynb" for installation of EarthEngine Python API in HydroShare.

* Open the "ReadmeFirst.ipynb" notebook and follow the instructions for additional necessary modules.

* That's it! You can start with the lab notebooks. Come back frequently, for updates, new labs, and and improvements.

TODO: 

DONE * Document the Google Drive API - HydroShare integration.

* Add more lab sessions.

DONE * Develop an example for creation of a HydroShare resource.

 DONE * Integrate https://github.com/samapriya/geeup in HydroShare for assets upload.


This work would not be possible without the help and work of the Google Earth Engine Team and Tyler Erickson (https://github.com/tylere), the Google Earth Engine Community (https://github.com/gee-community), the Stack Overflow archives and contributors (https://stackoverflow.com/) and the well documented GEE Python repository of Rosa Aguilar (https://github.com/rosaguilar/geetutorial)
