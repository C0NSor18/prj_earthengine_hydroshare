# EarthEngine HydroShare
This is an ongoing work to integrate Google EarthEngine (GEE) API funtionality into HydroShare in Python 3.x language for the Utah State University CEE/PSC/WATS 5003/6003 Remote Sensing of Land Surfaces Spring class. 

### Objectives of this git repository: 

* Use HydroShare to teach remote sensing under limited local computing (clour resources).

* Investigate ways to do research by combining Google EarthEngine API, Google Drive API, and HydroShare.

* Bring into Python language available online GEE JavaScript/Python examples.

### Current operational status:
This is a funtional "beta" version of the repository (April 2020).  

### HOW TO USE THIS REPOSITORY:

* If not done already, register for an Google Earth Engine account (free) here https://signup.earthengine.google.com/#!/

* Clone this repository into Hydroshare. The notebook "0 Git commands for HydroShare.ipynb" in this repository gives necessary information to do this.

* Follow the steps in the notebook "1 Google Earth Engine installation in HydroShare.ipynb" for installation of EarthEngine Python API in HydroShare.

* Open the "2 Using Earth Engine in HydroShare.ipynb" notebook and follow the instructions for additional necessary modules.

* That's it! You can run with the lab notebooks. Come back frequently, for updates, new labs, and and improvements.

TODO: 

DONE * Document the Google Drive API - HydroShare integration.

* Add more lab sessions.

DONE * Develop an example for creation of a HydroShare resource.

 DONE * Integrate https://github.com/samapriya/geeup in HydroShare for assets upload.
