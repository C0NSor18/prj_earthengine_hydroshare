# Project EarthEngine HydroShare
This is an ongoing work to integrate Google EarthEngine (GEE) API funtionality into HydroShare in Python 3.x language for the USU 5003/6003 Remote Sensing of Land Surfaces class. 

Objectives: 
Use HydroShare cloud storage / computing environment to teach remote sensing information under limited local computing capabilities (tablets).
Investigate ways to do research by combining Google EarthEngine API, Google Drive API, and HydroShare.
Bring into Python language available GEE examples in JavaScript.

This is a funtional "alpha" version of the repository. I consider it "alpha" because it has not been tested on another HydroShare/EarthEngine account (validation needed). 

Suggestions, collaboration, and questions are more than welcome!
