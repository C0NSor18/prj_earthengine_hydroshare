# Project EarthEngine HydroShare
This is an ongoing work to integrate Google EarthEngine (GEE) API funtionality into HydroShare in Python 3.x language for the Utah State University CEE/PSC/WATS 5003/6003 Remote Sensing of Land Surfaces class. 

Objectives: 

Use HydroShare cloud storage / computing environment to teach remote sensing science under limited local computing capabilities (tablets).

Investigate ways to do research by combining Google EarthEngine API, Google Drive API, and HydroShare.

Bring into Python language available GEE JavaScript examples.

This is a funtional "alpha" version of the repository (April 2019). I consider it "alpha" because it has not been tested on another HydroShare/EarthEngine account (validation needed). 

Suggestions, collaboration, and questions are more than welcome!

HOW TO USE THIS REPOSITORY:

1) Clone this repository into Hydroshare. The notebook "Git commands for HydroShare.ipynb" in this repository gives necessary information to do this.

2) If not done already, register for an Google Earth Engine account (free) and follow the steps in the notebook "EE_Hydroshare_installation.ipynb" for installation of EarthEngine Python API in HydroShare.

3) Open the "ReadmeFirst.ipynb" notebook and follow the instructions for additional necessary modules.

4) That's it! You can start with the lab notebooks. Come back frequently, for updates, new labs, and and improvements.


TODO: 

-Document the Google Drive API - HydroShare integration.

-Add more lab sessions.

-Develop an example for creation of a HydroShare resource.

-Integrate https://github.com/samapriya/geeup in HydroShare for assets upload.


This work would not be possible without the help and work of the Google Earth Engine Team and Tyler Erickson (https://github.com/tylere), the Google Earth Engine Community (https://github.com/gee-community), the Stack Overflow archives and contributors (https://stackoverflow.com/) and the well documented GEE Python repository of Rosa Aguilar (https://github.com/rosaguilar/geetutorial)
