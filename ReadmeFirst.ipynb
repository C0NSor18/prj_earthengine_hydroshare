    "This is a series of **jupyter notebooks** for integrating the vast array of spatial datasets stored in **Google Earth Engine** https://earthengine.google.com/ to the Hydroshare platform and store the code and results into HydroShare.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a live document, that is updated with the semesters and years. So it will keeep evolving.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what is expected from you to run these notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) You are able to import or upload resources (notebooks) from  internet / Github and store it in a HydroShare folder (unzipped, of course). \n",
    " For example, you should be able to bring these github notebook repositories to your Hydroshare folder to respective subfolders: \n",

    " \n",

    " \n",

    " A nice description on how to use git commands to **\"clone\"** git repositores into Hydroshare is in this document:\n",
    " (Ask Jeff/Tony about this)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) You are familiar (not necessarily an expert) in Python. Why use Python? Because of the Pandas library. (I am a Matlab guy and this is my main reason to to migrate to Python). If you do not know much about Pandas, here is a good description about it: https://www.learnpython.org/en/Pandas_Basics (this is a meh link, need something better). \n",
    "\n",
    "3) Complete the EarthEngine Hydroshare integration steps as described in this *notebook*. This is done ONE TIME ONLY. After completion, you just need to go to Step 4.\n",

    "4) When comming back to work on these lectures, open a terminal and run (copy and paste) the following lines:\n"
